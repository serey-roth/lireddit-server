Deploy Backend To Dokku Steps:

1. Get a VPS (virtual private server). In Ben Awad's tutorial,
he created a droplet on DigitalOcean. It didn't work out for me
so I chose AWS EC2 instance. 
-- With AWS ec2, choose Ubuntu ARM64 for server because our docker images will
have ARM64 as the architecture due to our OS system (macOS)
2. ssh into the instance
3. install docker and dokku in the VPS
postgres and redis (look at the official docs for dokku)
4. create app with dokku and install plugins such as postgres and redis
and link them altogether (check official dokku docs)
5. set up DockerFile and .dockerignore file locally in node
7. build with command 'docker build -t <docker-account>/<app-name>:<app-version> .'
8. push to Docker hub with 'docker push <docker-account>/<app-name>:<app-version>'
9. in the VPS, pull docker image 
10. initialize app repository from docker image 'dokku git:from-image
<dokku-app-name> <docker-image-name>
-- this will deploy the docker image
11. set up custom domain 
-- change proxy http port
-- encrypt custom domain: don't panic if there is 'certificate cannot be found' error
---- the dns for the custom domain is still propagating
12. all done
13. every time you make changes to your local files, rebuild and push the docker image locally;
-- pull and deploy the new image in the VPS
